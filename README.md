This is the source code for my [Pomodoro Clock](https://edkerforne.github.io/pomodoro-clock/), a React-based clock to help you manage your time with the Pomodoro Technique.

It was made for the freeCodeCamp [front end libraries challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock). You can see the built code [here](https://github.com/edkerforne/pomodoro-clock/tree/gh-pages).
