This is the source code for my [Pomodoro Clock](https://edkerforne.github.io/pomodoro-clock/), a React-based clock to help you manage your time with the Pomodoro Technique. After you press "Start", the tab's title displays the time remaining for your session or break.

It was made for the freeCodeCamp [front end libraries challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock).
